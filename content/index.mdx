## About Prison Rodeo Programs

**The Texas Prison Rodeo Program digital collection is made possible by the generosity of The Texas Prison Museum in Huntsville, Texas.**

The Texas Prison Rodeo, which ran from 1931 to 1986, was billed as "the wildest show of its kind ever staged," and was the first prison rodeo in the U.S.. Beginning in 2022, SHSU's Newton Gresham Library and The Texas Prison Museum collaborated to digitize the museum's collection of Texas Prison Rodeo souvenir programs. During the project, The Texas Prison Museum provided physical copies of the rodeo programs to Newton Gresham Library for digitization and digital preservation. The Texas Prison Rodeo Program collection contains programs for the annual Texas Prison Rodeo from 1938 to 1986.

This exhibit aims to highlight the collection of Prison Rodeo programs and related items in our Special Collections Room, provide a brief history of the prison rodeo, and guide users to additional sources for continued research.
